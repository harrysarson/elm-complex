# elm-complex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/harrysarson/elm-complex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/harrysarson/elm-complex)

## Library of mathematical functions enabling complex calculations in [elm](https://elm-lang.org).

The module [`Complex`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/harrysarson/elm-complex/latest/Complex) defines an opaque `Complex` type which represents a complex number.

Basic functions are provided to work with complex numbers and care has been taken to ensure consistancy when complex numbers are NaN (i.e. zero divided by zero) or Infinite (i.e. one divided by zero).

## Roadmap

- Support for trigonometic functions.
